			<h3><u>Description</u></h3>
			<p>The graph is actually two graphs combined. The one on the left is a scatter plot that shows job category and pay distribtion, whereas the histogram shows pay distribution throughout all job categories. The data shows pays for around 950 jobs. I used math to determine the annual pay even for semi-annual full time pays as well as full time hourly pay.</p>

			<h3><u>Understanding the graph</u></h3>
			<p>This complex graph is a little harder to understand than the last. That's because its actually two graphs combined into one that shows a lot of information. This graph was also extremely difficult to create, because first I had to understand the code and then I had to edit it so that if fit my needs. On the left there is a strange scatter plot. This scatter plot shows the distribution of pay for each job category (the next pie chart shows purely the distribution of job categories). Then on the right side there is a histogram which makes it easier to see which pays are most popular with the NYC government. In short the histogram shows how many different pays there are and the scatter plot shows different pay for each job category. By looking at the histogram you can figure out what pay is the most popular in the NYC government and by looking at the scatter plot you can see which jobs pay the most on average.</p>

			<h3><u>Importance</u></h3>
			<p>Since this graph shows the most information, it is probably the most interesting and important one on this website. The importance is that some jobs pay more than others even in the NYC government. For example, Finance and enginneering have an average pay $100,000 annually, whereas  Clerical and Social work on average pays only half of that at $50,000 a year. Additionally, most people that will work for the government will be earning between $50,000 and $100,000 a year. This is important since the city basically dictates what the average job should pay, and according to the public job openings, between $50,000 and $100,000 a year is average pay. It's also important to note that there is a large percentage of jobs that pay only around $25,000. The poverty line in NYC is about $32,000 for two adults and two children, so the city is supporting its workers. However, the scary fact is that there is huge income inequality even in public work with many people earning close to $100,000 and some earning less than $50,000 annually. </p>
