		Do frogs make good pets

	<p>
		<h3>Contrary</h3> to popular belief frogs love their owners like dogs and don't annoy them like cats
	</p>

	<p>They also don't need a lot to survive- only water and some food</p>

	<p>they can also be trained to do cool tricks like flip and bake cookies</p>

	<p>As an owner of a frog, you will be thrilled with the experience</p>
