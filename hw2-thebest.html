	<h1>Why are frogs the best animal</h1>

		<p><h3>A</h3> frog is a simple animal it eats and it sleeps</p>

		<p>
		unlike other animals it doesn't try to do anything, its not living for us, its living for itself
		</p>

		<p>
		say for example a cheeta, why does it run so fast. It doesn't have to. It's just showing off. 
		</p>

		<p>another reason frogs are the best animal is because they eat flies</p>

		<p>nobody likes flies so lets give frogs a round of applause</p>
