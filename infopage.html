			<h2><u>Information about this site</u></h2>

			<p>Today over 300,000 people are employed by the largest local government in the United States, NYC.</p>

			<p>These people work everyday to provide the 8 million residents of the NYC metropolitan area with the best possible service (even though the trains don't run very well) and ensure our safety</p>

			<p>The city offers many benefits such as comfortable retirement packages as well as good health care and vactions</p>

			<p>City jobs are one of the most important things today. Even in such difficult times, the city still offers all generations with work opportunities</p>

			<p>I have been increasingly interested in working for the city because they employ the most high school students in the city (more than any other organization).</p>

			<p>When I was searching the web for large data sets, I found a very large API that had every public job opening in the city.</p>

			<p>I created this is the site to showcase all of the interesting and facinating statistics that I have graphed about the public work sphere in NYC</p>

			<h2><u>Why I chose this topic</u></h2>

			<p>I chose this topic because recently I have been more interested in jobs as I was searching for summer work.</p>

			<p>Throughout my search public job openings kept on coming up for teens as well as for experienced workers.</p>

			<p>Then as I was searching around the internet for large data sets to analyze, I found an API that showed all job openings in NYC which sounded very exciting.</p>

			<p>After dwelving into the data, I realized that this could be big opportunity to start learning about data analysis which is a crucial skill in IT.</p>

			<p>This topic also seemed the most plausible because the data in the form of a json file was already very neat and only needed some cleaning up.</p>

			<p>I also decided to create graphs and chart with that data because I really enjoyed using madplotlibs.</p>
