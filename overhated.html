	<h2>
		Why are frogs overhated
	</h2>

	<p><h3>Frogs</h3> are overhated because sometimes they make annoying sounds</p>

	<p>
		However, many things make annoying sounds like your brother and maybe your dog but you don't hate them, so stop hating frogs
	</p>

	<p>
		Also some people hate them becuase they are icky which is ridiculous and a stupid reason to hate frogs
