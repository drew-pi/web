			<h3><u>Description</u></h3>
			<p>This pie chart shows the distribution of jobs offered based on experience and level. As you can see there are almost no executive job openings and a large majority of Experienced (non-manager) positions. Another thing to note is that there are actually a lot of entry-level jobs open right now.</p>

			<h3><u>Understanding the graph</u></h3>
			<p>The pie chart is pretty simple to understand. The function of this chart is to show the distribution of these openings out of a total sum. The entire "pie" is some 1000, job openings and each "slice" is a percent of that. So the largest slice, the blue colored one, is the biggest proportion of job openings on the graph. Similarly, the green colored one makes up the smallest proportion of job openings at only aroud 5% or even less. </p>

			<h3><u>Importance</u></h3>
			<p>This statistic is not important in the sense that it will solve some world problem or show context for a strange trend, but it's still interesting and can reflect trends in NYC today. For example, many skilled laborers have left NYC to go find better opportunities else where. This pattern is occuring in California, Chicago and Seattle right now. This shows why there are so many experienced (non-manager) positions open right now. Additionally, it makes sense that close to no executive positions are open right now since executive positions pay a lot of money and many people become attached to those jobs. However, what doesn't make sense is that entry-level jobs make up a large minority of jobs. This is strange because today there is a lot of unemployment and its surprising to see that these entry level jobs aren't being filled up quickly. Another thing that's interesting is that there are lots of manager positions open, which also probably goes back to the fact that many skilled laborers have left NYC for other places. I think this distribution reflects the current post-COVID (hopefully) NYC, and if this program was run maybe two years ago, I think that the distribution would have been totally different. </p>
