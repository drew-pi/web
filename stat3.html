			<h3><u>Description</u></h3>
			<p>This pie chart shows the distribution of jobs offered based on job type. There are 5 jobs that are very evenly distributed, but then there are some that account for less than 5% of job openings. The legend on the right shows all of the jobs and their respective colors, unfortunatey some job types have similar colors, but most of them are straight forward. Also constituent might seem like a strange job type (at least I didn't know what that was), but its pretty simple. They are just people that tie all of the government departments together and helps coordinate between departments. </p>

			<h3><u>Understanding the graph</u></h3>
			<p>The pie chart is pretty simple to understand. The function of this chart is to show the distribution of these openings out of a total sum. The entire "pie" is some 1000, job openings and each "slice" is a percent of that. So the largest slice, the purple colored one, is the biggest proportion of job openings on the graph. Similarly, the second brown colored one makes up the smallest proportion of job openings at only aroud 5% or even less. </p>

			<h3><u>Importance</u></h3>
			<p>I thought that it would be cool to see this because I was interested in what types of jobs the government was offering. Most of them are pretty standard such as technology and legal. One that I foud interesting was community and social work. I thought they would make up much more of the pie chart, but surpisingly they together make up less than 10% of the openings. This is interesting, but most likely it comes down to volunteer work as in NYC volunteering for different causes is a big part of our culture. Finance making up such a large portion of the chart also surpised me because I was expecting that most of these positions were already filled, so most likely the city is facing a financing worker shortage. In all this chart shows a bunch of trends that can be tied to current events, and also shows what types of jobs are most empty right now. </p>
