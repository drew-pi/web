		<h2 id="s1">Why are frogs the best animal</h2>

		<p>a frog is a simple animal it eats and it sleeps</p>

		<p>
		unlike other animals it doesn't try to do anything, its not living for us, its living for itself
		</p>

		<p>
		say for example a cheeta, why does it run so fast. It doesn't have to. It's just showing off. 
		</p>

		<p>another reason frogs are the best animal is because they eat flies</p>

		<p>nobody likes flies so lets give frogs a round of applause</p>

			Why are frogs overhated
		</h2>

		<p>frogs are overhated because sometimes they make annoying sounds</p>

		<p>
			However, many things make annoying sounds like your brother and maybe your dog but you don't hate them, so stop hating frogs
		</p>

		<p>
		Also some people hate them becuase they are icky which is ridiculous and a stupid reason to hate frogs
		</p>

		<h2 id="s3">
		Do frogs make good pets
		</h2>

		<p>contrary to popular belief frogs love their owners like dogs and don't annoy them like cats</p>

		<p>They also don't need a lot to survive- only water and some food</p>

		<p>they can also be trained to do cool tricks like flip and bake cookies</p>

		<p>As an owner of a frog, you will be thrilled with the experience</p>
